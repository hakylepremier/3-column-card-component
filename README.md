## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this project I learnt that when using flex some elements make behave like block elements which will throw you off a bit but align items start will most likely help:

```
.card{
  align-items: start;
}
```
